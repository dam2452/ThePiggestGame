### Bad Ice-Cream Style 2D Multiplayer Game (UE5)

**Project Status**: **On Hold**

This is a **2D multiplayer game** inspired by *Bad Ice-Cream*, built in **Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)** using **Blueprints**. The game features early mechanics for:

- **Multiplayer gameplay**.
- Basic **building system** for structures.
- **Combat system** allowing players to attack opponents.
- A **simple menu** for navigation and game setup.

### Current Progress:
- An **early demo** is available, showcasing the core features, but the game is still in a very early stage.
- Implemented basic multiplayer mechanics with rudimentary gameplay.

### Blueprint-based Development:
The game was developed using **Blueprints** to speed up the process, as the person I intended to collaborate with is not a programmer. However, if needed, I have no issue **rewriting the code in C++** for more advanced customization and performance.

### Reason for Pausing:
The project is currently **on hold** due to a lack of satisfying **pixel art** assets. Additionally, other projects have taken priority.

However, the game **may be revisited** in the future once better assets are available and other projects are completed.

### Collaboration:
If you're interested in helping with the project, feel free to **reach out**! Whether it's **art, programming, or gameplay ideas**, all contributions are welcome.

**Please note**: While I encourage collaboration, please **do not copy or use this game concept without my involvement**. Let's work together to bring it to life!
